The Troll Under the Bridge

Once upon a time, a troll lived beneath an old stone bridge in the misty mountains.
This troll had a peculiar appetite—he was quite fond of eating sheep.

Every morning, shepherds would drive their flocks across the bridge to reach the
pastures on the other side. The troll would emerge from his dwelling, blocking the path
with his enormous frame and demanding payment. But often, he would simply reach out and
snatch a plump sheep from the herd instead.

The sheep feared the troll greatly. They would bleat and scatter whenever they heard
his heavy footsteps echoing beneath the arches. The troll, however, seemed content with
his simple life—eating sheep and guarding his bridge.

One day, a clever shepherd arrived with an idea. He offered the troll cheese and bread,
foods the troll had never tasted before. Delighted by this change, the troll agreed to
let the sheep pass unmolested in exchange for these treats.

And so, the troll ate fewer sheep, the shepherds kept their flocks, and an unlikely
peace settled under the bridge.

The End.
